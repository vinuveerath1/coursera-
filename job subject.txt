Dear Sir/Mam, 

My name is Vinoth Rajagopal. I am sending my resume to enquire regarding suitable job opportunities in Singapore. I recently moved to Singapore on a dependent pass in October last year with my wife. She is a CRM consultant with one of the local companies here in Singapore and has been on E Pass for the past 7 years. 

My family has our own apparel boutique back home in India. I have a total of 12 years’ experience managing an apparel store. I used to be a technical support executive before that. I am an extrovert who loves to learn new things and give my best in any work I take up. I am looking for opportunities in Sales/Procurement or related positions. I am also open to tech support roles from my prior experience as I thrive in a customer-facing role. I would be delighted to discuss any possible relevant vacancy with you at your convenience.

Thank you in advance for the opportunity.

Regards,
Vinoth Rajagopal
